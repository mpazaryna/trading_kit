    Run backtest on the given strategy function.

    This function applies a trading strategy to historical market data to generate trading signals.
    The strategy function should take the market data and any additional parameters as input and return
    a series of signals indicating when to buy or sell.

    Parameters:
    - data (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing historical market data, including price information.
    - strategy_func (callable): A function that implements the trading strategy. It should accept the
      market data and any additional parameters defined in **params.
    - **params: Additional parameters to be passed to the strategy function.

    Returns:
    - pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the generated trading signals.
